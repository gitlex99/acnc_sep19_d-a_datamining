The program is intended to discover new knowledge and insights to (hopefully) help make evidence-based actions/strategies, with particular interest in the Australian charity sector.

Questions (mostly focused of scale of charity):
* Which charity section tend to have more financial resources? (classifying scales into numerical values; small=1, med=2, large=3)
* Which region has more charity (exclusive)?
* Does a charity's region affect/influence the scale of the charity?
* Does the number of directors/responsible persons affect the scale of a charity?
* Does the age of the charity affect the scale (or other attributes) of a charity?
* Are there any charity service gaps affecting certain regions, demographics or communities?
